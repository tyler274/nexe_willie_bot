# nexe_willie_bot
because IRC is terrible and no one should be forced to use it, 

Depends on "willie", install with "pip install willie"

Copy bot.cfg.example to bot.cfg and configure with your server (and user's) settings

Start with "willie -c bot.cfg" 

Intended to work with NCdot's IRC and written for a friend. 


Can be integrated into allianceauth
